    "When the internet was first created in the 1960s, it was made with one crucial assumption in mind: that anyone could be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, this made perfect sense--its only use back then was to connect scientists from all around the globe so they could easily work with each other. Everyone was united in the same goal of research and development--there was no reason to harm anyone else, or break the thing that connected them all together. Even today, system priorities are often convenience first, security second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the 1960s and now, though, things have changed. People from all walks of life now roam the internet, from celebrities to ordinary people. Net content has ballooned, from news to data sites to cat videos. And while the internet has ushered in a new age of convenience and connectivity, not all walks of life are good ones--and not all internet content is friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2007, the Petya and WannaCry viruses struck, the first hobbling and nearly shutting down a whole company, the second locking banks and hospitals out of their own files until they paid a ransom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, another cyberattack crippled Baltimore's 911 systems, forcing calls to be relayed manually, and costing responders precious time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the wrong link, or download the wrong file, and if your data isn't stolen or held for ransom, your computer could be enslaved to a botnet or damaged beyond repair. Even visiting a malicious site could result in malware infecting your system, without any other input from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's impossible to defend against every attack, especially as the internet grows and changes, it's still possible to mitigate the risk of malware infection. A good way to defend against malicious websites, for example, is building an internet blacklist--a type of filter that blocks malicious websites from reaching the user. The only problem with this approach is that the internet is a massive place, and it would take forever to examine each and every website to see if it's dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where data science comes in. While the term \"data science\" has multiple definitions, at its core, it applies computational and statistical techniques to either address or gain insight into a real-world problem. With the ability to process large amounts of data in seconds, and the help of a large-enough dataset, data science can predict life expectancies, analyze text, or even identify buildings at risk of catching fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a binary classifier: a tool that can determine whether an object is one type of thing, or another. Our goal is to not only get familiar with the data science pipeline, but gain a better understanding of what makes, or doesn't make, a website malicious."

It effectively stores two variables in the same column, by the nature of state and province names.\n",

This means that for any missing values in our data columns, interpolate() will take a look at the column value that comes before the NaN, and the value that comes after it, before calculating a new value based on those points. It's effectively like building a bridge.\n",

While the interpolate() function can easily deal with groups of NaNs clumped together, using it in CONTENT_LENGTH would have resulted in clumps of identical values, and skewed data as a result. Talk about a bridge too far!"

    "We've finally made it to the exploratory analysis section. Here, we can begin constructing a binary classifier using the technique of logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "While normal datasets, like ones that track life expectancy, would use linear regression as a technique to find the line of best fit for the graph, binary classifiers are a special case. Unlike normal graphs, which can have multiple values for dependent variables, like 45 years, 70 years, or any year in between, binary classifiers have only two possible values: 1 and 0, or in our case, malicious and non-malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that finding a normal line or polynomial wouldn't make sense for the classifier. After all, there are only two choices for dependent value, in this case, the website type. Thus, we'll use a different technique to construct our binary classifier: [logistic regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-la3q9d7AKQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is different from linear in that it can only yield data values between 1 and 0, using what's called a sigmoid function: a function that has a distinctive curve like the Greek letter Sigma:\n",

    "Any data fed into the sigmoid function is used to calculate a probability variable, which is used to decide whether the classification of the data is 1 or 0.

If the probability is above 50% for example, there's a good chance that the value we're looking for is a 1--which in our case, would mean a malicious website. If below or equal to 50%, however, the odds are low that the data is a 1 value, so a 0--which signals a benign website for us--is returned instead.\n",

    "The most important things to keep in mind when trying to identify any unknown website are how many special characters are contained in the URL, and how many ports are connected to your computer. Knowing what character set the website uses, or how long the URL is could also help you, though not to as big of a degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as projects go, this one was both fun and frustrating, as I got to learn how to deal with poorly-written datasets, how to perform logistic regression, and how to cross-validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, I learned that you always need to be on your guard for errors when making a dataset. Check your work at every step, and be aware of any values appearing where they shouldn't be, like random letters in a column with dates, or a 100% accuracy rating being constantly shunted out by your own accuracy calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had to the project again, however, I would do it with more and better data. The biggest problem with the project, aside from the messy data, would have to be dearth of malicious website data. For a moment, I thought I would not find any trends, due to how little of it was actually in the set. Having more malicous data would make the binary classifier overall, and could turn up interesting trends in the data that I didn't notice before.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also test more variables, and in different ways, like seeing if the percentage of packets sent from your server to the remote website server contained any special information, or finding a better way to measure the qualitative values. While one could plausibly say that the year a website was registered has no bearing on its maliciousness or lack thereof, the lack of connection between the types of countries, or the connection associated with the character sets, could easily be due to happenstance, given their code numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the chance, I would gladly take on a similar project for this in the future. But for now, I hope you enjoyed my little tutorial, and I hope you have a pleasant day."
